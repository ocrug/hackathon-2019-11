# Areas where we could improve
* Add time at the start of the tutorials to help people with wifi and introduction (15 min)
* Sign in desk was slow. Have the name tags preped ahead of time and layed out in alphabetically order
* Allow an hour for registration.  People will be late, want to get coffee, etc.
* Have a username and password to log into the presentation system
* Get dongles to convert between different video connections
* Make sure the food / snacks are in the same location
* Presentations/annoucements to the entire group (e.g. intro talk, tutorials, group presentations) should use a microphone.
* Two big jugs for getting water for the coffee pots
* Volunteers need clearer instructions on what they need to do at on each shift
* There were no volunteers for the saturday clean-up.
* Have post event survey ready in advance
