Hello:

Thanks for your support of the upcoming hackathon and presenting your tutorials on this coming Saturday morning.

Please plan to arrive by 8:30 if possible so you can grab some breakfast and coffee before the tutorials start.  FYI: it could be a bit busy getting into the structure in the morning so you might want to leave some extra time.

Just to confirm the schedule of events for Saturday morning:

* 9:00 - 9:45: Arlo, Data manipulation with tidy tools
* 9:45 - 10:30: Emil, Data visualization with glottal
* 10:45 - 11:30: Ryan, Data modeling with caret
* 11:30 - 12:30: John, Using packages for Literate Statistical Programming

You can see the full schedule on our GitHub repo: https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019-11

We would like to put the presentation slides on our repo before the event if possible.  Please send them along to John or me.  No problem if you have last minute updates -- we can push those after the tutorials.

Please feel free to stay (or leave as it may be) through out the weekend. We will have free snacks and lunch on both days.

Parking info is [here](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019-11/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf)

When you enter the parking structure, stay in the right lane and you can purchase a ticket at the automated kiosk. We'll reimburse your parking at the event.

Let us know if you have any question and thanks again!
Ryan
