Dear judges:

Thank you all for support of our upcoming Hackathon and being judges.  We are looking forward to having a great event this weekend!

I wanted to pass along some information:

When you have a moment, please read through the [judging guidelines](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019-11/blob/master/admin/judging_guidelines.md), which describes the different categories the teams will be judged on.


The schedule of events is list on the main page of the [hackathon GitHub repo](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019-11).

Please plan to arrive at UCI by 1:30 PM on Sunday.  Teams will start their presentations at 2PM, and everything should wrap-up by 4PM.  You are more than welcome to come at 12 PM if you'd like to have lunch with us.

Finally, [here](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019-11/blob/master/parking/Parking%20and%20Building%20Location.pdf) is information about parking.


When you enter the parking structure, stay in the right lane and you can purchase a parking permit from the automated kiosk.  We will reimburse you for your parking fee at the event.

Let us know if you have any questions and thanks again for your support of the group and the event!

Thanks again and looking forward to seeing you this weekend,
Ryan Benz
